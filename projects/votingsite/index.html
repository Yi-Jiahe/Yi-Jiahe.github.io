The system was developed to cut down on the paper used for the physical ballots, as well as reduce the logistics involved.

SQLalchemy was used for the database.</p><p>To limit each voter to one vote, a 5 letter case-sensitive one-time password was emailed to each voter, which was then deleted when it was used or replaced. I implemented a running key cipher in the python code to encode the used passwords, as well as a running key cipher in a VBA script, used by a moderating party to ensure all the votes were valid, while ensuring anonymity. In this way, all votes were accountable to a voter, but no one party would have both the voter&rsquo;s one time password and their vote.</p><p>On the voting day, the source code was uploaded to GitHub and hosted as a Heroku app running a Postgres server.</p><h2 id=testimonials>Testimonials</h2><blockquote><p>The electronic voting system has improved the efficiency of our voting process significantly. It not only allowed us to tabulate the results within minutes, but also allowed voters who were overseas to participate in the elections via the easy to access portal. The encryption also ensures we are able to meet the same demands of accountability and anonymity as the traditional system. Most importantly for us, we wanted to reduce the amount of paper waste produced from printing over 200 traditional voting pamphlets. The system has already been handed down to the next batch of scholars in the committee and works amazingly.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Sowmya Srinivasan Iyer, Vice-President 11EC</li></ul></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"></div><hr></div></div></div><a id=scroll-to-top class=btn><i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i></a></section></div><footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=http://jiahe.dev/#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=http://jiahe.dev/#experiences>Experiences</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=http://jiahe.dev/#skills>Skills</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=http://jiahe.dev/#education>Education</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=http://jiahe.dev/#projects>Projects</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact me:</h5><ul><li><span>Email:</span> <span>yi.jiahe00@gmail.com</span></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><p>Stay up to date with email notification</p><form method=post action=https://blogtrottr.com><div class=form-group><input type=email class=form-control name=btr_email placeholder="Enter email"><br><input type=hidden name=btr_url value=http://jiahe.dev/index.xml>
