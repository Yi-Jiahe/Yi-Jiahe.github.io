# Subjective Testing Of Parametrically-decoded First-Order Ambisonics In Cinematically-reproduced Virtual Reality

In my second year at NTU, I secured a research attachment at the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at NTU where they were researching the use of Virtual Reality technologies for use in soundscape design. In particular, the project I worked on focused on evaluating the suitability of various audio decoding methods for use with such technologies using subjective testing.

During my time there I learnt about the motivations behind the project, and also picked up some technical skills. In preparing the recordings for the experiments, I worked with a digital audio workstation as well as tools used to sync the 360 degree video with the sound recording, in order to achieve audio-visual congruency. I had the opportunity to conduct the experiment as well, allowing me to practice interviewing the tester while they interacted with the recordings. Finally, I worked with IBM's Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) as well as the R project for statistical computing to interpret the data as well as produce plots for the report.
