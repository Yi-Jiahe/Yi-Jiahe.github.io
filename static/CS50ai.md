# CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

I took an online course by Harvard which explored the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence. 

The course featured a number of projects covering topics such as:
* Utilizing search algorithms such as depth first search and breadth first search to solve basic problems and a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play tic-tac-toe.
* Implementing logic to maintain a knowledge base to tackle logic problems and write a minesweeper AI.
* Make use of probability rules and distributions to implement a page rank algorithm by sampling and iteration, as well as determine the probability of inheriting and expressing a gene based on a family tree and some known information about the gene.
* Implementing a constraint satisfaction algorithm to assign words to a crossword using inference.
* Trained a neural network to predict how shopper behaviours influence the probability of them making a purchase and used reinforcement learning with Q-learning to teach an AI to play Nim.
* Trained a CNN to identify signs using the GTSRB dataset.
* created a parser using the Python NLTK toolkit to parse sentences using context free grammar, and wrote an AI to answer questions using a corpus of information pulled from Wikipedia using tokenization and tf-idf to identify sentences which best fit the query. 

By completing these projects and a number of quizzes, I earned a certificate showing my completion of the course.
